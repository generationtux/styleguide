      These are stylistic element that serve a purpose of driving the aesthetic of the brand, but only in conjunction with the full logo type or secondary marks.

      Brand accessories can be places in bottom corners of images in either black or white, and also used overlapping elements such as floating and non floating images, color containers and in certain use cases, large type. They may be used sparingly and tastefully (so as not to give a watermark effect) on top of other elements with a lowered opacity .

      The 726 elements are an ode to where we came from as a company. Both to the original brand that the suits were manufactured under, and a numerical representation of our founder and CEOâ€™s initials.
